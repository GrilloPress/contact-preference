<div class="terms-and-conditions-list"><ol class="terms-and-conditions-list__overall-list"><li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item">Introduction<ol><li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">Welcome to the terms of use (“Terms”) for the NHS COVID-19 Vaccination Status Service (“Service”), which is available through the NHS App and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://covid-status.service.nhsx.nhs.uk/" class="nhsuk-link nhsuk-link--no-visited-state-link external-link">https://covid-status.service.nhsx.nhs.uk/</a>&nbsp;from a web browser.</li><li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">The Department of Health and Social Care (‘DHSC’, ‘we’, ‘our’) has overall responsibility for the Service, which has been developed by, and will be operated by, NHSX (a joint working arrangement between DHSC and NHS England). For the purposes of clause 7 ‘we’ is deemed to include NHS Digital with respect to liability for NHS Digital’s role as the certifying authority.</li>
  <li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">NHS Digital is the certifying authority, which means it certifies that it has provided the information about your vaccination history to the Service, on behalf of NHS England, for the vaccination database it operates (the Approved Source System). This contains vaccination information supplied from the COVID-19 vaccine point of care systems approved by NHS England, who is the controller for and operates the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme in England.</li>
  <li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">These Terms apply to the Service only. There are separate terms of use that apply to: (i) the NHS App; and (ii) NHS login. For the purposes of the NHS login, the Service is a “Connected Service”, for the purposes of the NHS App the Service is a “Platform Service”.</li></ol></li><li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item">Purpose of the Service<ol><li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">The purpose of the Service is to allow you to produce a digital ‘COVID-19 vaccination status’, which includes a 2D barcode.  This Service allows you to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination history. The Service can be used to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status for the purposes of international travel as some countries may require you to provide them with evidence that you have been vaccinated before you are allowed to enter their country, and potentially for some domestic purposes, which the Government may approve from time to time.</li>
    <li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">The Service is not intended to be used by employers for the purpose of testing the COVID-19 vaccination status of their employees, or for any other purpose not approved in Government guidance.</li><li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">The Service is provided by DHSC free of charge, and it is expressly prohibited to attempt to sell or license use of the Service to any person, or to include the Service as part of a paid-for service or product.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item">How to use the Service <ol>
  <li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">To use the Service, you must either i) first download the NHS App, which you can do here: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-app/" class="nhsuk-link nhsuk-link--no-visited-state-link external-link">https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-app/</a>or ii) you can visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://covid-status.service.nhsx.nhs.uk/" class="nhsuk-link nhsuk-link--no-visited-state-link external-link">https://covid-status.service.nhsx.nhs.uk/</a>&nbsp;from a web browser.</li>
  <li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">If it is your first time using the Service then you will need to set up NHS login credentials and prove who you are.  In order to use the Service for international travel, you will need to complete the highest level of identity verification.  This involves an online or offline identity verification process where physical comparison between you and a photographic form of identity has occurred.</li><li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">It is important that you keep your NHS login credentials confidential and do not share these with any other person.</li><li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item nhsuk-u-font-weight-bold">We strongly recommend that you test the Service at home, prior to using it in a live setting, to ensure it works correctly and to give you time to discuss any issues with us (see the contact information provided below) or to consider alternative options to using the Service (such as taking a coronavirus test) where these are available.</li>
</ol></li>
<li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item">How the Service works<ol>
  <li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">The Service works by establishing whether you have received both doses of the same COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li class="terms-and-conditions-list__list-item__sub-item">The Service does this by using your NHS login credentials to verify your identity, and to retrieve your Covid-19 vaccination data (if applicable) from the Approved Source System. It is important to note that the Service is dependent on external data sources, and on data sharing permissions, including those given to your GP. If in doubt, please refer to 119.</li>
