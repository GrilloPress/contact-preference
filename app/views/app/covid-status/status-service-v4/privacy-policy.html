<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">How the Covid Status Certificate uses your data and what your rights are</h2>

<div><h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Introduction</h2><p class="nhsuk-body">The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is providing a service to you that will produce a COVID Status Certificate. This will allow residents in England to display (either electronically via a smartphone, or manually on paper) their COVID vaccination history.</p><h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m nhsuk-u-padding-top-4">How does the service work?</h3><p class="nhsuk-body">Digital users: Users of the digital service can use an NHS login to authenticate into the service. Data will then be retrieved from existing data we hold to provide a Certificate of your vaccination history on your smart device.</p><p class="nhsuk-body">Non-Digital (Covid 119): Users will be asked to provide name, date of birth and postcode. If these identify a relevant history, then a letter will be produced and sent to the address we hold for correspondence.</p><h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m nhsuk-u-padding-top-4">What is the purpose for the processing of personal data?</h3><p class="nhsuk-body">The principle of the Covid Status Certificate programme is to ensure that illness and death from Covid-19 can be minimised as the UK’s social and economic life is re-established. This will apply both during and after the Government “roadmap” allows citizens to emerge from the restrictions placed on the country during the COVID-19 pandemic response.</p><p class="nhsuk-body">The Covid Status Certificate provides citizens with evidence of their vaccination history. As the country resumes normal functions, this data will be useful for further aspects of unlocking as they arise, e.g for International travel or attendance at domestic events once these have been permitted by government policy and guidance.</p><h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m nhsuk-u-padding-top-4">What does the Covid Status Certificate service do?</h3><p class="nhsuk-body">The service enables you either to view, or to receive   a letter indicating, your COVID-19 vaccination history.</p><h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m nhsuk-u-padding-top-4">What do I need to do?</h3><p class="nhsuk-body">To access the service you will need to register for a user account via NHS Login (for the digital service) if you don’t already have one. Alternatively, you can provide your name, date of birth and postcode to access a Covid-119 (non digital) letter service.</p></div>
