        <h2>Treatment for sinusitis from a GP</h2>
        <p>If you have sinusitis, a GP may be able to recommend other medicines to help with your symptoms, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="javascript:void(0)">steroid nasal sprays or drops</a> - to reduce the swelling in your sinuses</li>
          <li><a href="javascript:void(0)">antihistamines</a> - if an allergy is causing your symptoms</li>
          <li>antibiotics â€“ if a bacterial infection is causing your symptoms and you're very unwell or at risk of complications (but antibiotics are often not needed, as sinusitis is usually caused by a virus)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You might need to take steroid nasal sprays or drops for a few months. They sometimes cause irritation, sore throats or nosebleeds.</p>
        <p>A GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if, for example, you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>still have sinusitis after 3 months of treatment</li>
          <li>keep getting sinusitis</li>
          <li>only have symptoms on 1 side of your face</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They may also recommend surgery in some cases.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Surgery for sinusitis</h2>
        <p>Surgery to treat chronic sinusitis is called functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).</p>
        <p>Fess is carried out under <a href="javascript:void(0)">general anaesthetic</a> (where you're asleep).</p>
        <p>The surgeon can widen your sinuses by either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>removing some of the blocked tissue</li>
          <li>inflating a tiny balloon in the blocked sinuses, then removing it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should be able to have FESS wihtin 18 weeks of your GP appointment.</p>
        <p>The ENT UK website has more <a href="javascript:void(0)">information about FESS (PDF, 506kb)</a></p>
